title: Building Your First Flow
description: Learn how to quickly set up Flowly and create your first interactive flow diagram.

After successfully installing Flowly, it's time to create your first interactive flow diagram! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get a basic Flowly instance running and add your first nodes.

## 1. Prepare Your HTML And Initialize Flowly

First, you need a container element in your HTML where Flowly will render your flow. This is typically a `div` with a unique ID.

Create an `index.html` file (or add to an existing one) with the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Flowly App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="[https://unpkg.com/flowly@latest/dist/flowly.css](https://unpkg.com/flowly@latest/dist/flowly.css)">
    <style>
      /* Basic styling for the flowly container */
      .flowly-container {
        width: 100%;
        height: 500px; /* Adjust height as needed */
        border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
        border-radius: 8px;
        box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
        background-color: #fcfcfc;
      }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Flowly Diagram</h1>

    <div id="flowly-container" class="flowly-container"></div>

    <script src="[https://unpkg.com/flowly@latest/dist/flowly.min.js](https://unpkg.com/flowly@latest/dist/flowly.min.js)"></script>
    <script>
    import Flowly from 'flowly'; // If using npm/pnpm/Yarn
    // If using CDN, Flowly will be available globally, you can remove this import.

    // Initialize Flowly by passing the ID of your container
    const flowly = new Flowly('flowly-container', {
        // Optional: Customize the background
        background: {
            type: 'dots',
            color: '#d5d5d5',
            dotColor: '#8d8d8d',
            dotSize: 2,
            dotSpacing: 35
        },
    });

    console.log('Flowly initialized!', flowly);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
##### Key Points:
- Make sure the **id="flowly-container"** matches the ID you will use when initializing Flowly.
- The **flowly-container** needs a defined **width** and **height** in your CSS for Flowly to render correctly. We've added some basic inline styles for demonstration.
- Remember to include Flowly's CSS and JavaScript files as per the [Installation](/getting-started/installation/) guide.

##### Understanding the Flowly Constructor
The **Flowly** constructor takes two arguments:
1. **containerId** (string, required): The ID of the HTML element where Flowly should render the flow.
2. **options** (object, optional): An object to configure the Flowly instance. Common options include:
- **background**: Customize the canvas background (dots, grid, or none).
- **readOnly**

## 2. Adding Your First Node

Now that Flowly is initialized, let's add a node to your flow. You can add nodes programmatically using the **addNode** method.

**Modify your script tag:**

```js
document.getElementById('add-node-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Add a simple node
    flowly.addNode({
        posX: 100, // X position on the canvas
        posY: 100, // Y position on the canvas
        name: 'My First Node', // The title displayed on the node's header
        id: 'node-1',
        // Optional properties:
        data: {
            // Custom data associated with this node
            info: 'This is a sample node!'
        },
        input: {
            name: 'Input Port',
        },
        output: {
            name: 'Output Port',
        },
        showHeader: true, // Show or hide the node's header (default: true)
        htmlContent: '<div>This is the **content area** of your node.</div>' // Custom HTML content for the node body
    });
    console.log('Node added!');
});
```

##### Understanding **addNode** Options
The **addNode** method accepts an object with various properties to define your node:
- **posX**, **posY** (number, required): The initial X and Y coordinates of the node on the canvas.
- **name** (string, optional): The title displayed in the node's header.
- **data** (object, optional): A plain JavaScript object to store any custom data associated with the node. This data is persistent and can be accessed later.
- **input** (object, optional): Defines the input port for the node. It can have a **name** property.
- **output** (object, optional): Defines the output port for the node. It can have a name property.
- **showHeader** (boolean, optional, default: **true**): Determines if the node's title bar should be visible.
- **htmlContent** (string, optional): Allows you to inject custom HTML content directly into the body of the node.

## 2. Interacting with Nodes (Optional: Quick Look)
Flowly provides methods to interact with nodes after they are created. Here are a couple of common ones:

##### Getting a Node by ID
You can retrieve a node object using the unique ID you provided when calling **addNode**:
```javascript
let node = flowly.getById('node-1');
console.log(node);
```

##### Updating a Node
You can update a node's properties dynamically using the **updateNode** method.
```javascript
flowly.updateNode('node-1', {
    name: 'Updated Node Title!',
    htmlContent: '<div>This content was **dynamically updated**!</div>',
});
```
