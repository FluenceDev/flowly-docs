## Installation Methods

You can install Flowly using one of the following methods:

### 1. Using a Package Manager (Recommended)

This is the recommended method for modern web development workflows

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    #### Step 1: Install Flowly via npm

    Open your terminal in your project's root directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm install flowly
    ```

    #### Step 2: Import Flowly into your JavaScript

    In your main JavaScript file (e.g., `src/main.js` or `index.js`), import Flowly:

    ```javascript
    import Flowly from 'flowly';

    // Now you can initialize Flowly
    const flowlyInstance = new Flowly('#your-container-id');
    ```

    #### Step 3: Include Flowly's CSS

    Flowly includes its own default styling. You'll need to include its CSS file in your project. The exact method depends on your bundler setup.

    * **If you're using a CSS loader (e.g., in Webpack/Vite):**

        ```javascript
        import 'flowly/dist/flowly.css';
        ```

    * **Alternatively, link it directly in your HTML (less recommended for bundlers):**

        ```html
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/flowly/dist/flowly.css">
        ```
        *(Note: Adjust the path if your `node_modules` directory isn't at the root.)*
  </TabItem>

### 2. Using a CDN

For quick prototyping or simpler projects without a build tool, you can include Flowly directly from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

**Step 1: Include Flowly's JavaScript and CSS in your HTML**

Add the following lines to the `<head>` or before the closing `</body>` tag of your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Flowly App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/flowly@latest/dist/flowly.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="flowly-container" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; border: 1px solid #ccc;"></div>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/flowly@latest/dist/flowly.min.js"></script>

    <script>
        // Initialize Flowly after the DOM is loaded
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
            const flowlyInstance = new Flowly('#flowly-container');
            // You can now start adding nodes and edges
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
