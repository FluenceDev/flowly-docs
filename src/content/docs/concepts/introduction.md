Welcome to **Flowly.js** — a simple and lightweight **Flow Builder** built with Vanilla JavaScript.

This library is in its early stages and was created to provide a minimal foundation for building visual node-based editors, such as flowcharts, automation tools, or basic logic editors — without relying on heavy frameworks or complex dependencies.

## 🛠 What is it?

**Flowly.js** lets you create and connect nodes on a canvas using basic drag-and-drop interactions. It's aimed at developers who want full control over the UI and logic, while still having a starting point for building a visual editor.

It’s not a full-featured editor yet — but it’s growing step by step.

## ✅ Current Features

- Drag and drop nodes on a canvas
- Basic connections between nodes
- Simple API to define nodes and edges
- Event listeners for custom behavior
- Pure Vanilla JS, no frameworks required

## 🔍 Use Cases (Early Stage)

- Prototyping custom flow editors
- Creating internal tools with node logic
- Learning how flow builders work under the hood

## 📦 Who is this for?

- Developers who want to build a flow UI from scratch
- Those who prefer Vanilla JS over frontend frameworks
- Anyone curious about how node-based editors work

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is in early development. Expect frequent updates, possible breaking changes, and new features being added over time.
